# Collision Simulation
Team project that simulates collisions using JavaFx and Animation. 

## Description
Interactive simulation to help understand the principles of collisions. 
Concepts such as mass, momentum, speed, direction and elasticity are applied in this application. 
Various scenarios will be shown to showcase the collisions between the objects better.

Lauching the application will show the main menu where the user chooses a desired scenery. 

    -Default

    -Asteroids

    -Cars

    -Pool balls

In the Default scenario, the user can add and remove objects in the main window. Every object has physics implementation. That is the,

    -Mass

    -Direction

    -Velocity

    -Elasticity

The mass of the objects can be increased and decreased, the object will visually change accordingly to the changes.

All objects will have a moveable and stretchable arrow on them that decides the direction and velocity of the object.

The user can also adjust the elasticity of the objects by interacting with a slider.

## More Features
The user can start, stop or reset the simulation willingly.

A hide button can be activated to hide the extra details such as the arrows on the objects and the velocity values.

A volume slider and mute and unmute button are used to change the volume of the objects crashing with each other.

Upon clicking on the numbered object, the user can change the color of the object.

Using the save button the user can save the current settings that they have made on the scenario.
